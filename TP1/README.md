## Project information

- [Scene](./scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T3_G02_v02.xml)
- A portal 2 test chamber (to those who love the game the XML should have a nice surprise at the start), featuring many different and detailed props:
  - Cube dropper
  - Cubes
  - Doors
  - Turrets
  - Hard light bridge
  - Piston platform
- The walls use texture amplification to use the same texture file containing a single "tile" to be repeated.
- Parser with a very extensive error checking and correction, giving detailed logs when something is wrong and fixing the problem the best it can.
